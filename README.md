# Graph-shortest-path-and-MST

This program contain 4 shortest path algorithms: Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, Matrix Multiplication, Floyd
And 2 MST algorithms: Prim, Kruskal

IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FREE-SCALE-GRAPH. It's just because I continued on my previous work.

The main function is about runing time test. You can get the all-pair shortest path matrix in txt format for the 
distance algorithm and the MST cost for the MST algorithm.

For the graph input format, please refer to the Graph folder
